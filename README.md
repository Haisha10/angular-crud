# ANGULAR-CRUD

In this project, we will learn to create a **Web Application** based on the **Angular** framework. Also to implement **CRUD** instances in order to manage data in the web app. 

## Project creation

Run `ng new [project-name]` to create a project with a desired name. In this case will be **angular-crud**.

You will be asked if you want to add Angular Routing and to choose a stylesheet format. In this case we **will use Angular Routing** and **CSS** as stylesheet format.

## Project deployment

Run `ng serve --open` in order to **deploy** your web app. The *--open* parameter means that once the project is compiled, it will open automatically on your default browser.

You can stop the process using the key combination `Ctrl + C`.

## Adding Angular Materials

Run `ng add @angular/material` to add **[Angular Material](https://material.angular.io/components/categories)**, a **user interface library**, to your project.

You will be asked for a **prebuilt theme** name, we will use **Indigo/Pink**, also if you want to use **Angular Material typography styles** and **Angular animations modules**, in this case we will use them.

## Creating a new component

Run `ng generate component [compent-name]` to create a component which will contain an app feature.
